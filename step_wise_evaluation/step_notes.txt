- setting filters mostly okay
- struggle with APPLYING the filters and or recognizing that a filter has been successfully set!
- problematic: checkboxes smaller than annotation of bounding boxes (for VisualBrowsingAgent)

RESULT VisualBrowsingAgent:
- 30% have a URL as an answer
- only 1 out of 10 has an answer that has been visited
- but 50% of runs have reached an URL that fulfills all checkpoints (e.g., at some point, all filters were set correctly)


step 7:
- early stopping, provides one correct answer but does not continue
- queries and prompts to the agent have to be specific
